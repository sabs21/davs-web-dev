:: Transfer Protocol

set winscp_protocol=
:: Server Host
:: The name of the server to connect to.

set winscp_username=
:: Server Hostkey
:: An identifying code generated as part of the SSH protocol to defend against spoofing. To get the hostkey on WinSCP's GUI, first connect to the remote server, then go to Tabs > Server/Protocol Information. You'll want both the algorithm and the hash (likely SHA-256) values for the syntax shown below.
:: Syntax: Algorithm Hash 
:: Example: ssh-rsa 3072 4cA6A4SEa50fRFwLluS2hcGTRRZX2ed0FR71xZZq2Kc

:: Local Directory to Sync
